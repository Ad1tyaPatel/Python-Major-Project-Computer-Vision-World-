# Project Name - Computer Vision World


This is a major project, in this project I have build a Computer Vision dashboard which includes five different computer vision programs in it like, VIRTUAL WHITEBOARD, VIRTUAL
KEYBOARD, VIRTUAL MOUSE, VIRTUAL VOLUME CONTROLLER, AND
VIRTUAL FINGER COUNTER with the help of Machine learning, OpenCV, Mediapipe, and python which helps us to use keyboard, mouse,whiteboard, volume controller and all virtually.
We will be using the computer vision techniques of OpenCV to build this project.
Let us understand that what is VIRTUAL WHITEBOARD, VIRTUAL KEYBOARD, VIRTUAL MOUSE, VIRTUAL VOLUME CONTROLLER, VIRTUAL FINGER
COUNTER, AND VIRTUAL CALCULATOR.

Virtual Whiteboard – Virtual Whiteboard is a computer vision program which can draw anything on it by just capturing the motion of our finger with a camera.

Virtual Keyboard – Virtual keyboard is a computer vision program by which we can type anything virtually without touching the keyboard physically. We can just type anything on the computer screen by the scanning our hand.

Virtual Mouse – This is an AI virtual mouse system that makes use of the hand gestures and hand tip detection for performing mouse functions in the computer using computer vision.

Virtual Volume Controller – This is a computer vision program that allows the user to perform hand gestures to control the volume of our computer.

Virtual Finger Counter – This is a computer vision program which detects our fingers when we show our hand in the front of our computer camera and then this will tell us that how many fingers we have lifted.

Virtual Calculator - A virtual calculator using OpenCV and machine learning is a project that involves creating a software-based calculator that can recognize handwritten or printed mathematical expressions, perform calculations, and display the results on the screen.




## How to run the code

1. Import the folder in your vs code.
2. Install python and some of its libraries like OpenCV, mediapipe, numpy, Tkinter, etc.
3. Before running the code make sure to change the path of every image according to your  computer where you have saved all these images.
4. Run the "Computer vision world.py"
5. Now you can explore the whole project.
